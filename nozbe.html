		<a href="#inbox/1">
		<p>
			How can I add new actions?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			There are several ways for adding new actions. The first and most basic is to enter new action via &#8216;new action&#8217; button found in the right hand corner of the central panel. You can add them being in given project, in calendar view, next action list view and Inbox.
		</p>

		<a href="#inbox/2">
		<p>
			Is it possible to add new actions via other applications?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Yes, most other application that work with Nozbe support sending actions to Nozbe. The most popular being of course email and Twitter.
		</p>

		<a href="#inbox/3">
		<p>
			Can I add more the one action at a given time?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Yes, you can. To do so simply click on &#8220;add action button&#8221;. When the new action&#8217;s window opens click on &#8220;options&#8221; and at the bottom you will find a clickable link &#8220;Add more actions at once&#8221;.
		</p>

		<p>
			Please remember to put each action in a separate line.
		</p>

		<a href="#inbox/4">
		<p>
			Can I use parameters when adding actions?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Yes. There are several ways you can format the name of an action to make it auto adjust parameters. Here is the full list:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>DATES</strong> just write the date in the task name like “on Friday”, “tomorrow”, “next week”, “on Feb 28” and Nozbe will understand it! (dates need to have “on” or “at” before, and tomorrow and next week don’t need that)
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>CONTEXTS</strong> – just use the @ (at) sign and put your context name (no space required)
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>PROJECTS</strong> – just use the # sign and put your project name, like “#my project”
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong><span class="caps">TIME</span> NEEDED</strong> – just use the % sign and put the time you need
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong><span class="caps">REPEAT</span> ACTIONS</strong> – just write “every ….” to mark the action should repeat every day, week…
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong><span class="caps">NEXT</span> ACTION</strong> – just use the ! exclamation mark and that’s it – it will be one of your next actions!
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong><span class="caps">FIRST</span> COMMENT</strong> &#8211; just type ##and the text after it
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			This formatting works for all “add actions” buttons in Nozbe, for your Emails, Twitter and any other way you would input actions into Nozbe.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here&#8217;s a helpful example:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Walk the dog on Tuesday #Private Stuff @Home %30 min every day !</strong>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Will add an action called &#8220;Walk the Dog&#8221; with the following parameters:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>on Tuesday</strong> &#8211; will schedule it for this coming Tuesday
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>#Private Stuff</strong> &#8211; will add it to the &#8220;Private Stuff&#8221; project (if this project exists on your projects list)
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>@Home</strong> &#8211; will add it to the &#8220;Home&#8221; context (again, if this context does exist)
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>%30 min</strong> &#8211; will mark it as a half-hour task
				</li>

				<li>
					! &#8211; will mark it as a next action (note the exclamation mark)
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			Now try yourself with some of your own parameters and check out the magic!
		</p>

		<a href="#inbox/5">
		<p>
			Does Nozbe understand dates when adding actions?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Yes, but it requires certain formatting.  In order to introduce a specific date you will need to remember to type before them &#8220;on&#8221; or &#8220;at&#8221;, only tomorrow and next week do not need this. E.g. if you wish to have an action named &#8220;read a book&#8221; completed on Tuesday and want to have Nozbe auto-fix the date for you, you will need to type in the name box &#8220;read a book on Tuesday&#8221;.
		</p>

		<p>
			Should you want to add specific time to your newly created action with a date, please type in the date field the date with time e.g. &#8220;tomorrow 10 a.m.&#8221; or &#8220;Friday 1 p.m.&#8221; or &#8220; 20 May 2010 8 am&#8221; and the time with provided name will be displayed as the due time for it.
		</p>

		<p>
			One more thing that was explained in the previous question but also applies here is that you can at the moment of creating an action you can add its repeat. After setting all other parameters simply remember to type &#8220;every&#8230;&#8221; e.g. taking our previous example &#8220;read a book on Tuesday every week&#8221; results in an action &#8220;read a book&#8221; happening every Tuesday.
		</p>

		<a href="#inbox/6">
		<p>
			How can I have <span class="caps">URL</span> in the name of an action?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Yes, just write it like this:
		</p>

		<p>
			(open quotes)Name of the URL*(close quotes):<a href="http://site.address.com" target="_blank">http://site.address.com</a>
		</p>

		<p>
			Here&#8217;s an example. If you write this:
		</p>

		<p>
			&#34Nozbe web site&#34:<a href="http://www.nozbe.com" target="_blank">http://www.nozbe.com</a>
		</p>

		<p>
			The formatted action will display this:
		</p>

		<p>
			<a href="http://www.nozbe.com" target="_blank">Nozbe web site</a>
		</p>

		<a href="#inbox/7">
		<p>
			Can I add Notes to actions?
		</p></a>

		Sure. Each action has a small bubble next to its name (with a + if no comments added or with number of existing comments/notes). It is called comments, but people use it for different purposes. You are more then welcome to use comments as notes.

		<a href="#inbox/8">
		<p>
			How can I make my newly created action appear either at the bottom, or at the top of the list?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			When you click on “New action” you can see an arrow pointing &#8220;top&#8221; on the left side of the input field. Upon clicking the arrow will change its direction to &#8220;bottom&#8221;. When it does, your new actions, notes and files will appear at the bottom of their respective lists.
		</p>

		<p>
			Keep an eye on the arrow since it changes the place where things appear in Nozbe. If generally you want new things to be at the top of your lists but sometimes would prefer to have them at the bottom make sure you change the arrow&#8217;s orientation by clicking on it right before closing the “Add action” form.
		</p>

		<a href="#inbox/69">
		<p>
			I have deleted my Inbox. What can I do?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Simply create a project called Inbox and by going into its options mark is as the real Inbox. If you&#8217;d like to choose another existing project for your Inbox you can also do so. Please note that there should be only one Inbox in an account.
		</p>

		<a href="#inbox/71">
		<p>
			Why can&#8217;t I see duplicates of my reoccurring actions for coming days?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			The explanation is quite simple. There are two requirements that have to be fulfilled in order for the duplicate to appear. The first is that the original action has to be completed, and the second that the action has been archived. Consequently, you won&#8217;t see a duplicate until your 1st login on the next day after completing given action.
			<br />
			Thus if your task is not completed there won&#8217;t be a reoccurrence until you do complete it.

		<h2 id="help_section_9" class="help_section help_section_projects"><a href="#projects">Projects</a></h2>

		<a href="#projects/9">
		<p>
			How can I reorder my projects?
		</p></a>

		Simplest way is to drag and drop them in the place of your liking.

		<a href="#projects/10">
		<p>
			Why Nozbe won&#8217;t allow me to create sub-projects?
		</p></a>

		Sub-projects are similar concept to prioritizing them. Both of these features add nothing but clutter to the projects and task lists. They make you create lengthy lists you no longer feel like doing&#8230; and spend too much time organizing tasks into lists instead of checking them off. Nozbe stands for: “Simply Get Things Done” – and the effort of our app (and why you’re using Nozbe in the first place) is to make sure we do everything to help you accomplish more and focus on what’s next… instead of managing tasks.

		<p>
			You can organize projects with labels, which is far more efficient than doing it by hierarchy like sub-sub-projects.
		</p>

		<a href="#projects/11">
		<p>
			How can I use labels to substitute sub-projects more efficiently?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Just make sure all of the projects you want in one group have the same &#8220;label&#8221;. Like all home-related project have label &#8220;Home&#8221;.
		</p>

		<p>
			When you click on the label &#8220;home&#8221; above your project list, your list of projects will just display the projects from this label only.
		</p>

		<p>
			Moreover, if you click on the &#8220;Projects&#8221; link, you&#8217;ll even be able to see all of the actions in this label, grouped by projects. This is great for doing a <span class="caps">GTD</span> Weekly Review of your actions and projects.
		</p>

		<a href="#projects/12">
		<p>
			How can I use contexts to substitute sub-actions in projects?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Just as with projects and labels the same way you can use contexts in case of actions.
		</p>

		<p>
			Just tie together under the same context the actions which otherwise would be seen as sub-actions.
		</p>

		<p>
			Since it is possible to add multiple contexts you may decide that your sub-actions are all linked with one context and secondary context may be used to define tools, locations or moods.
		</p>

		<a href="#projects/64">
		<p>
			Why I can&#8217;t see any label section in my Nozbe?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			This is most likely caused by the fact that there are no labels on your account yet. The label section appears only after the creation of the first label and that can be done either when creating a new project, or by changing its details (click on the project and then click &#8220;info&#8221; right next to its name)
		</p>

		<a href="#projects/75">
		<p>
			How do I change or delete a label?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			The procedure is quite simple:
		</p>

		<p>
			1. click on labels above project list
			<br />
			2. choose label you wish to get rid of or change
			<br />
			3. click on the trash can icon near “edit label” if you wish to remove it or on &#8220;edit label&#8221; if you wish to change it.
			<br />
			4. click on ‘ok’ once prompted if you wish to remove it
		</p>

		<a href="#projects/76">
		<p>
			How can I modify a label?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			If you wish to change a label attached to your project you need to enter project‘s Info and click on the label there… this will enable you to add a new one or to remove the one you had before. It is possible to use more then one label for a project.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you wish to change a label, please click on the ‘labels’ button on the left and select label you wish to edit. Once the button changes from Labels to given label you will be able to click on it to see ‘edit label’ and do with it as you wish.

		<a href="#next_actions/15">
		<p>
			Which actions become my next action automatically?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			The following items become your Next Actions per definition:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				overdue items from previous days (date in red)
			</li>
			<li>
				any action scheduled for the given day
			</li>
			<li>
				actions delegated to you by other users, when they mark that you&#8217;re responsible for doing them
			</li>

			<li>
				any action, which you have marked with a star regardless of project or due date.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<a href="#next_actions/66">
		<p>
			What are &#8220;Next Actions&#8221;? Why are they marked with a star?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			According to the <span class="caps">GTD</span> (&#8220;Getting Things Done&#8221;) book by David Allen, next actions are these actions that move your projects forward.
		</p>

		<p>
			You are a busy person. You wouldn&#8217;t be using Nozbe if you weren&#8217;t one.
		</p>

		<p>
			This is why it&#8217;s important to <span class="caps">FOCUS</span> in order to get things done. This is why your main goal is to identify 1 (max 3) next actions in each project that is on your plate and later only look at the Next Actions list to get these done.
		</p>

		<p>
			Thanks to Nozbe, you can mark next actions with a simple &#8220;star&#8221; and later view your &#8220;starred&#8221; actions on your Next Actions list and focus on getting these done.
		</p>

		<p>
			You will not be distracted by looking at all of your tasks and projects &#8211; only at your Next Actions&#8230; and thanks to Nozbe you&#8217;ll get these done! Good luck!
		</p>

		<a href="#next_actions/73">
		<p>
			How do I filter my Next Action view?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			The first option is to arrange actions via drag & drop. However, far more efficient is to use the funnel, provided you have added contexts to your actions. By using it you can limit the Next Action view to only actions with given context e.g. work

		<a href="#contexts/16">
		<p>
			How to add a new context or modify a current one?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Adding a new context is very simple. On the right side of your screen you can see the Context section with &#8220;+New&#8221; button.
			Modification is also quite simple and very similar to changing details of an action or project. You simply have to click on the context and when it appears in the central part of the screen click on &#8220;info&#8221; near it&#8217;s name. You will then be able to edit it and change it&#8217;s icon, if that is what you wish.
		</p>

		<a href="#contexts/17">
		<p>
			How to change a context in an action?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Contexts are easily amendable. Simply enter given action and click &#8220;x&#8221; to remove given context or add a new one next to it.
		</p>

		<a href="#contexts/18">
		<p>
			What is the purpose of contexts and how can I use them?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Contexts in the sense of <span class="caps">GTD</span> are normally understood as moods/locations/tools that help you get things done. Thus, per definition a context is there to help get things done at the place you are, with the tool you have or with the mood you are in.
		</p>

		<p>
			They help you group actions requiring specific circumstance to be performed i.e. you are going to a shopping mall and you want to get some groceries (action no.1), buy a skirt (action no.2), drop coat off at dry-cleaner (action no.3) those 3 separate actions can be tied by a context &#8220;shopping&#8217; or &#8220;shopping mall&#8221;.
		</p>

		<p>
			In Nozbe once you click on given context all your actions get filtered and you will only see actions with given context.
		</p>

		<p>
			Thus helping you not to forget anything and allowing you to have all actions with certain context to be viewable in one place.
		</p>

		<p>
			Contexts can also be used as a substitute for sub-tasks (please read more under question: How can I use contexts to substitute sub-actions in projects? )
		</p>

		<a href="#contexts/19">
		<p>
			How many icons for a context can I choose from?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Currently there are 32 colorful icons available  for contexts. We are planning on bringing more in the future with a possibility to upload a custom icon by yourself. It&#8217;s coming soon.
		</p>

		<a href="#contexts/20">
		<p>
			Can I add tags or categories to actions, or are contexts a similar thing?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Of course you can. Context can be used in many ways as you can add many of them to an action. Some users use them only as contexts, for others it is a way to categorize or tag their actions and some use them in all those possible meanings (simply by stating that 1st context is a context, 2nd one serves as category etc.). It is up to you how to use them and in which sense.

		</p></a>

		<p>
			Notes are easily format-able via parameters found below the note&#8217;s window at the time of creation. Please allow me to quote all the possibilities here. (no need to know <span class="caps">HTML</span> or any other language, just these simple techniques:

			How do I synchronize my Evernotes with Nozbe and vice versa?
		</p></a>

		The process is quite simple. Click on the Evernote button in Nozbe (found in each project under files section) and follow the instructions. You will be asked to log into your Evernote account and then to authorize Nozbe&#8217;s access.  Please remember that in order for your notes to synchronize properly the tag in evernote must equal to project name in Nozbe.

		<p>
			How do I attach files and documents to projects?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Once you have a project created you can scroll down and see the Notes and Files sections. In the files section you will find &#8220;new file&#8221; button that when clicked upon will allow you to upload into Nozbe any file you like (size limit 10MB). You can also move your files and documents between projects using the Drag & Drop function (the same way you can do it with notes and actions).
		</p>

		<a href="#reference_materials/24">
		<p>
			Can I see thumbnails of my images or photos, uploaded to Nozbe?
		</p></a>

		Yes. Simply place the pointer over the name of a given file and a small thumbnail will pop out to show you the image.

		<a href="#reference_materials/25">
		<p>
			Can I upload new versions of files or documents to Nozbe?
		</p></a>

		Yes, it works same way like uploading any other file. Just go to the file you want to update and click &#8220;Edit&#8221;.

		<p>
			You&#8217;ll see an &#8220;Upload new version&#8221; button and click on it and just upload new version of the file right there. You&#8217;ll see all of the versions of the files in their details.
		</p>

		<a href="#reference_materials/26">
		<p>
			Can I edit my uploaded documents directly in Nozbe?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Unfortunately not. We strongly suggest amending your documents in their native application and simply replacing the old version of a given document with new one in Nozbe.

		<p>
			Which mobile platforms are supported by Nozbe?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			At the current stage Nozbe has native applications for iPhone and iPad. Additionally, all other mobile devices are able to access Nozbe via on-line mobile versions <a href="huwww.iNozbe.com" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.iNozbe.com" target="_blank">www.iNozbe.com</a></a> (designed for iPhones but works well on most of modern smarphones that support Blackberry, Android or Windows Operating systems) and <a href="http://www.nozbe.mobi/" target="_blank">nozbe.mobi</a> for traditional mobile phones.  We are currently developing native application for Andriod (avaliable for beta testing at Android Market).
		</p>

		<a href="#on_the_move/28">
		<p>
			Can I use iPhone or iPad applications offline (i.e. without Internet Connection) and synchronize later?
		</p></a>

		It is of course possible. To ensure smooth offline working we suggest switching off auto-synchronization (options available in <span class="caps">INFO</span> of the application) and using manual synchronization instead.

		<a href="#on_the_move/29">
		<p>
			What can I do if my iPhone or iPad application fails to synchronize properly?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Hopefully this won&#8217;t happen to you, but sometimes it&#8217;s necessary.
		</p>

		<p>
			The first solution, which in 99% of the cases solves the issue, is to enter &#8220;info&#8221; of your application and use &#8220;reset data&#8221; button.
		</p>

		<p>
			It will remove all of the information on your iPhone or iPad without interfering with information stored on the server. Once that completed simply synchronize with the server and it all should be fine.
		</p>

		<p>
			If this fails for any reason, there is A second resource, namely, a re-installation&#8230;
		</p>

		<a href="#on_the_move/30">
		<p>
			Can I use iPhone application on iPad? Why do you recommend native iPad application instead of iPhone?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Of course it is possible. However, we strongly recommend using the native iPad application on those devices. First of all per definition if a software is designed for given device type it works on it much better than something else that is just compatible but not quite right. Secondly we refrain from taking responsibility for working of iPhone application on iPad, though it should work fine. And last but not least the iPad application is especially designed for this device and therefore  its graphics are way nicer than the iPhone&#8217;s applications and are made to fit the screen with all its possibilities.
		</p>

		<a href="#on_the_move/31">
		<p>
			Why aren&#8217;t the iPhone and iPad applications free?
		</p></a>

		The application is not free because it features unlimited projects and contexts and can be used without synchronization with Nozbe&#8217;s online version. This means, it can be used as an alone-standing application and you don&#8217;t need to have a Nozbe account in order to use it. However, to make the most of the app we suggest synchronization (thus having a regular Nozbe account). In such situation you get a 30 days free Personal account  or a totally life-time free account with 5 projects and contexts.

		<a href="#on_the_move/32">
		<p>
			How do I reinstall iPhone/iPad application on my devices?
		</p></a>

		In order to un-install the application you will need to remove it from your device via iTunes. Preferably also remove the profile. In order to do so please enter on your devise Settings->General ->Profile then click on remove. Once those two steps have been done, please go back to your iTunes and reinstall Nozbe. Don&#8217;t worry, you won&#8217;t be charged again. Once you&#8217;ve paid for the app, it&#8217;s paid for forever.

			What happens if I add an action task in calendar view?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			If you use the &#8220;add action&#8221; button in the calendar view to add an action it will auto-default to &#8220;today&#8221; as a due date unless you enter an action with a specific date parameter (then it will become due on the date provided by you).
		</p>

		<p>
			E.g. adding an action called &#8220;test&#8221; will result in an action named &#8220;test&#8221; with today as its due date. However, if you type in the name line type &#8220;test on Friday&#8221; it will appear as &#8220;test&#8221; action but due on coming Friday.
		</p>

		<p>
			NOTE: all other parameters work here as specified earlier.

		<a href="#appointments/35">
		<p>
			Does Nozbe synchronize with Google Calendar?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			There is a new and full synchronization with Google Calendar. In order to link your Nozbe account with it please enter your Nozbe calendar and click on the link found there. It will redirect you to Google page and request your authorization.
		</p>

		<p>
			Upon successful synchronization, you will see an additional calendar called &#8220;Nozbe&#8221; in your &#8220;my calendars&#8221; section in Google Calendar.
		</p>

		<p>
			You will be able to add action with specific time into Gcal and see them upon refreshing your page in Nozbe.
		</p>

		<a href="#appointments/36">
		<p>
			Is it possible to add a time-specific deadline and not only a date to an action?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Yes it is.  Once the action is formed and you move onto editing it&#8217;s details in the date field enter the date + time.  E.g. You have an action &#8220;call Tom&#8221;  and want it due on Monday at 10 am. In the date field type &#8220;Monday 10 am&#8221; and click &#8220;ok&#8221; button. The due time will be displayed as &#8220; Monday (in a date format e.g. XX-month-year 10.00). You can also provide an exact date and time e.g. 10 May 2010 11am &#8212;>10 May 10 11:00
		</p>

		<a href="#appointments/63">
		<p>
			How to stop synchronization between my Nozbe and GCal?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Simply go to your Calendar on Nozbe. Click on &#8220;info&#8221; and on &#8220;Google Calendar&#8221;. There choose option &#8220;disable sync&#8221;.

			Please note that GCal synchronization creates in your Google Calendars a new Calendar called Nozbe. If you do not have it highlighted, the appointments won&#8217;t show. Also if you enter an item into general GCal and do not have Nozbe one highlighted, the actions entered won&#8217;t show in Nozbe.

The two system are separate.</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			To send actions to Nozbe via Email, start off by going to &#8220;Settings&#8221; to set up your <strong>nickname</strong> and <strong>PIN</strong>.
		</p>

		<p>
			From now on, your personal Nozbe email is:
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Nickname.PIN@nozbe.us</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			(please make sure you get the domain right, it&#8217;s &#8220;nozbe.us&#8221;, not the .com that you&#8217;re used to)
		</p>

		<p>
			If your nickname is Ted and your <span class="caps">PIN</span> is 1234, your special Nozbe email would be: Ted.1234@nozbe.us
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Sending actions to Nozbe</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			Just compose an email to your new special Nozbe email, where subject doesn&#8217;t matter, and in the body of the message start listing tasks, always preceding them with an <strong>asterisk and a space</strong> like this:
		</p>

		<p>
			&#42 Walk the dog tomorrow @home
			<br />
			&#42 Start writing novel #Book @office %1 h !
		</p>

		<p>
			(as you can see, you can use all action parameters like # for project, @ for context or % for time needed, etc.)
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Sending actions with notes/comments</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			You can send actions with notes (comments) &#8211; this way you can quote the part of the email message that is important and it will be added as a comment to the action you&#8217;re adding.
		</p>

		<p>
			Just forward the email you wish to quote (again, subject doesn&#8217;t matter) to your special address and in the body of the message, write the action right below the part of the email you wish to quote. The rest of the email will be ignored.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here&#8217;s an example of a body of a message:
		</p>

		<p>
			Hello Mike! Make sure to remember that our new meeting on Tuesday is at Nozbe plaza hotel, 5th avenue, NY and bring your assistant with you. The meeting&#8217;s at 5pm but be there before 4pm so that we can talk about the details.
			<br />
			Take care,
			<br />
			- Tom
		</p>

		<p>
			&#42 Meeting with Tom at Nozbe plaza on Tuesday
		</p>

		<p>
			(as you can see, the &#8220;Meeting with Tom&#8230;&#8221; action will be added to Nozbe&#8217;s inbox with the contents of the email from Tom in the comment/notes section of the action)
		</p>

		<a href="#email_integration/14">
		<p>
			How can I email a new action already with a context or directly to a project?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			There are two ways of sending an action/actions via email directly to a specified project:
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Adding project name to your special address</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			One is adding a project name to the email address, like this:
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Nickname.<span class="caps">PIN</span>.project_name@nozbe.us</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			Example: if your project name is &#8220;Office stuff&#8221;, your nickname &#8220;Ted&#8221; and your <span class="caps">PIN</span> &#8220;1234&#8221; then you&#8217;d send email to: Ted.1234.office_stuff@nozbe.us
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Using parameters in actions (for both projects and contexts)</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			As you know, you can use action parameters to add actions to specified projects or contexts, just by typing:
		</p>

		<p>
			&#42 Action name #project name @context name
		</p>

		<p>
			If no project is specified, all the actions will go to your Inbox or if you don&#8217;t have one set up, to the first project on your list.
		</p>

		<a href="#email_integration/37">
		<p>
			How can Nozbe&#8217;s integration with email help me get more done?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Nozbe&#8217;s integration with email is a great plus to everyone who does not want to have hundreds of windows open. It is an easy and convenient way to send directly new tasks whenever you see a useful email. Depending on the formatting used you will use such email will end up either in a specific project or in Inbox taking form of a note to the project or as a new task with comments. This makes life a way easier when handling hundreds of email a day as without switching tabs or windows you can pass your messages directly where you need them.
		</p>

		<a href="#email_integration/38">
		<p>
			How can I send Notes to Nozbe? How does Nozbe know that I want to email a note, not an action?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Just write an email to your special Nozbe&#8217;s address specifying a subject (when you send actions, subject doesn&#8217;t matter) and a content of the email without any actions and asterisks &#8220;&#42&#8221; that could be understood by Nozbe as actions.
		</p>

		<p>
			Such emails will be simply converted into Notes, where the Subject will be the title of the note and the body of the email will be&#8230; you guessed it &#8211; the body of the note :-)
		</p>

		<a href="#email_integration/39">
		<p>
			Can I CC or <span class="caps">BCC</span> Nozbe?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Yes, you can CC or even <span class="caps">BCC</span> Nozbe when you&#8217;re sending email to someone else. The standard rules and formatting apply. It&#8217;s a great way of letting someone know what&#8217;s up and in the same time keeping track of these in Nozbe.
		</p>

		<a href="#email_integration/79">
		<p>
			What happens to an email that lacks this formatting?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Provided the email address used to pass it to is correct such email will end up as a note to your project.

			How can I connect my Evernote and Nozbe?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			The process is very simple. In any of your projects click on the &#8220;Evernote Notes&#8221; button found under Notes and Files sections. You will be prompted to access your Evernote account and there to authorize Nozbe&#8217;s access. Once that done you are all set and the only thing you have to remember about is that tag in Evernotes = project name in Nozbe.
		</p>

		<a href="#api/41">
		<p>
			What other online applications work with Nozbe?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Twitter, netvibes, my Yahoo and Google Calendar.
		</p>

		<a href="#api/42">
		<p>
			Can I use my Twitter to tweet directly to Nozbe?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Yes. First of all you will need to connect Nozbe with your Twitter. In order to do so please access your account panel ->Extras!. There you will need to introduce your Twitter nickname and save changes.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now you&#8217;re set. To send new tasks to Nozbe simply type a direct message to the Twitter user <a href="http://twitter.com/Nozbe" target="_blank">Nozbe</a> like this:
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>D Nozbe This is my action @home</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			Please note that Nozbe checks your Twitter every few minutes so it may take up to 10 minutes for a new task to appear in your Nozbe account.
		</p>

		<p>
			You can also use standard Nozbe parameters to specify projects with &#8220;#&#8221;, contexts with &#8220;@&#8221;, time needed with &#8220;%&#8221; and more&#8230;
		</p>

		<a href="#api/74">
		<p>
			How does the integration between Nozbe and Dropbox work?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			This integration is analogical to Evernote integration. In order to connect your Nozbe to Dropbox please go to any project, scroll down to the very bottom and click on &#8220;Dropbox files&#8221;. This button will take you to your Dropbox account and ask for approval of access. Once that done files from Dropbox should be visible in appropriate projects. Please remember that your Dropbox folder names need to be the same as given project names in Nozbe.

		<a href="#share_and_delegate/44">
		<p>
			How can I share a project?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			To share a project with someone please click on the project&#8217;s name. Once it appears in the middle part of the screen please click on &#8220;info&#8221; next to its name. On the drop down list you will see either &#8220;invite people to share this project&#8221;  or  (if you already share it with someone) &#8220; invite more people&#8221;  in a form of a clickable link.
		</p>

		<p>
			Upon clicking on this link you will have an option to either choose from your contact list or introduce an email of a new person.  NOTE: for sharing to take place the person invited has to accept the invitation.
		</p>

		<p>
			The person you&#8217;re inviting to share a project with doesn&#8217;t need to have a Nozbe account at the time of sending the invitation. They&#8217;ll be prompted to set up a free account to share a project with you.
		</p>

		<a href="#share_and_delegate/45">
		<p>
			What happens if I delegate a task to someone?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			The delegated action is marked for all to see with the name of the person you delegated it to.
		</p>

		<a href="#share_and_delegate/46">
		<p>
			Why can&#8217;t I mark an action delegated to someone as done?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Since the action was delegated, you have passed the responsibility for it to someone else and only they can mark it as done per definition.
		</p>

		<p>
			Naturally, you can edit the action and change the delegation to yourself and then mark the action as done. But then why delegate it in the first place? :-)
		</p>

		<a href="#share_and_delegate/47">
		<p>
			How do I invite a new user to my multi-user account?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Please note that only the owner of the multi-user account can invite people to his/her account.
		</p>

		<p>
			In order to do so please enter your &#8220;My Team&#8221; panel and go to &#8220;Contacts&#8221;. You&#8217;ll see the list of people in your Team and below a list of people you&#8217;re sharing projects with.

		</p>

		<a href="#share_and_delegate/48">
		<p>
			What are the characteristics of a multi-user account? And how can I benefit from them?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Multi-user accounts are composed of multiple single accounts tied into a team under one &#8216;master&#8217; account. They are very useful to teams and companies as with their Message Board and Recent Activities panels they allow everyone in the team to see recent activities and comment on them or to have a conversation/consultation on an issue immediately. They are also cheaper then a multitude of separate single accounts. Please note that since those are single accounts tied together all your private projects stay private and only the ones that you share are visible to others (same applies to actions).
		</p>

		<a href="#share_and_delegate/62">
		<p>
			How do I replace users on my multi-user account?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Please keep in mind this can be done only from the master account. In order to do so you have to enter My Team -> Contacts then choose the person you want to remove and click &#8220;x&#8221; next to their name. Then to add new person in their place simply invite as you have done originally.

		</p>

		<a href="#offline/54"> Is there a way to have a paper version of Nozbe for times when I&#8217;m not at my computer?</a>

		<p>
			Yes, of course. First of all you can print any of your projects and their action lists. You may also print your Next Actions. And last option is to print out your backup .txt version directly from your computer (this actually gives you the ability to print  the <span class="caps">ENTIRE</span> Nozbe content).

		<a href="#message_board/55">
		<p>
			What is the purpose of message board for teams?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Message boards are quite useful in team life. It is there to increase communication in the team and to make it easy and pleasant to use. It is particularly handy when not all team members are not constantly together (e.g. remote workers, independent consultants etc.). Message board allows you to introduce short messages that whole team can see at their discretion. Those can be alone standing messages or whole conversations as you are allowed to comment on each message. Thus message board can be even used as in-Nozbe chat for fast communication and consultation without having to call, or run to another room.

Our servers are backed up daily to separate servers in the same datacenter. Moreover, our backup servers are located on West Coast <span class="caps">USA</span> and the entire Nozbe database is being backed up every three hours and sent to the backup datacenter across the country.
			Our datacenter has more than 5 Internet providers for maximum redundancy and as mentioned before we&#8217;ve got Nozbe data and apps copied to our backup servers across the country.The attachments are backed up once a day and also sent to the backup servers in our datacenter and across the country.

			Where can I check my time zone settings?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Time Zone can be selected/change in your Personal Settings that can be viewed upon clicking on gear icon found under your name in the right column of Nozbe. It also contains Daylight Saving Time (Summer time) setting, that for those living in areas not observing this may cause 1 hour difference between devices.

			How can I change my billing information?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			Please be aware that there is no place to do that within our system. Mainly for your own safety we have chosen to use external billing systems such as 2Checkout or PayPal. And that is where your data is stored.
		</p>

		<p>
			The mode of changing depends on the system.
		</p>

		<p>
			In case of PayPal it is advisable you log into their system and conduct the change there. They will automatically cancel your subscriptions tied to the old card so you will either have to renew it directly at your account in PayPal or re-subscribe in Nozbe.
		</p>

		<p>
			In case of 2Checkout you have two options, either you can conduct change directly in your account with them or email us with a request for &#8216;update request&#8217;. In the second case, you will be sent by us an email via 2Checkout containing information on how to update your information. Please be aware such email will contain reference to Apivision.com as they are the owner of Nozbe.com.
		</p>

		<p>
			MultiCards also require you to log into their system and make the changes there.
		</p>

		<p>
			There&#8217;s  also a universal way to change your billing information. You can simply enter you account panel and choose the current plan then re-subscribe. In such case the old subscription gets canceled within 24 hours and the change is acknowledged.  Or you can always email us with an invoice request. Please be sure to provide what plan you wish to have the invoice for.
		</p>

		<a href="#billing/77">
		<p>
			What does the ‘cancel’ option mean for user?
		</p></a>

		<p>
			The option to cancel account is available under account icon (person icon under your name on the right). If you click on it, it will close your account and you will not be able to enter it again. However, if you wish to cancel the reoccurring on your order, please email us at support@nozbe.com.
		</p>

		<p>
			Reoccurring is pre-defined option for those paying via 2Checkout, PayPal (monthly and annual versions), MultiCards/2BuySafe (only monthly)... whenever, we offer other payment methods than the above – these need to be renewed manually.
