We've had some complaints recently about delivery drivers using our maps to locate addresses and dropping parcels at the wrong house.
Any maps using gis.gloucestershire.gov.uk

We've established that our maps are low quality and that they will produce unreliable results so errors are inevitable is anyone relies on them.

Can you please get your fleet managers to pass the message on to drivers that if they have developed a habit of using any of our gis.gloucestershire.gov.uk maps, the data on them is not reliable enough for address identification.

Can I ask that you share this with your UKMail subsidiary as we've recently had on complain about them.

Thanks
